# Development

How to build, run, and test Postcards, how the repo is laid out, and how work gets
done here — Spec-Driven Development via GitHub Spec Kit, with the project
[constitution](Privacy-and-Constitution.md) as the non-negotiable backdrop.

For what the app *is* and how it's structured at runtime, see [Home](Home.md),
[Architecture](Architecture.md), and [Features](Features.md). For where the reference
datasets come from, see [Data and Provenance](Data-and-Provenance.md).

---

## At a glance

- **Monorepo**: a pnpm workspace. The app lives in `apps/postcards/`; `packages/` is
  reserved for future shared ecosystem packages (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` globs `apps/*`
  and `packages/*`).
- **Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite → PWA, wrapped for native iOS/Android by
  Capacitor. MapLibre GL + PMTiles, IndexedDB (`idb`), Zustand, Zod. No Google, no
  backend.
- **Package manager**: `pnpm@10.33.0` (pinned via `packageManager`).
- **Node**: 22 (`.nvmrc`; CI uses `node-version: 22`).
- **License**: AGPL-3.0-or-later (open source, non-commercial intent).
- **Tests**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e, including an axe-core WCAG 2.1 AA gate).

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **22** (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`).
- **pnpm** 10.33.0 (`corepack enable` then `corepack use pnpm@10.33.0`, or install
  pnpm directly).
- For native builds only: Xcode (iOS) / Android Studio (Android). See
  [`docs/NATIVE-BUILDS.md`](../docs/NATIVE-BUILDS.md).

---

## Install, run, build

Run these from the **repo root** unless noted. The root `package.json` proxies the
common tasks to the app via `pnpm --filter postcards …`, so both spellings work.

```bash
pnpm install                       # install workspace deps (once)

pnpm dev                           # Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
pnpm build                         # production PWA build (tsc --noEmit && vite build)
pnpm preview                       # serve the built dist/

pnpm test                          # unit tests (Vitest, run once)
pnpm test:e2e                      # Playwright e2e (a11y, keyboard, privacy, offline, …)
```

Equivalent app-scoped forms (run from anywhere in the tree):

```bash
pnpm --filter postcards dev
pnpm --filter postcards build
pnpm --filter postcards test
pnpm --filter postcards test:e2e
```

### Base path

The same build is the self-hostable website, the PWA, and the payload Capacitor wraps
natively. `vite.config.ts` serves from `/` by default; the GitHub Pages workflow sets
`VITE_BASE=/Postcards/` so asset URLs, the PWA manifest scope, and the service worker
resolve under the repo subpath. See [Publishing](Publishing.md) for deployment.

---

## Scripts reference

All scripts below live in `apps/postcards/package.json`.

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | `vite` — dev server with HMR. |
| `build` | `tsc --noEmit && vite build` — typecheck-gated production build. |
| `preview` | `vite preview` — serve `dist/` locally. |
| `typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` — strict TypeScript, no emit. |
| `test` | `vitest run` — unit tests once (`tests/unit/**`). |
| `test:watch` | `vitest` — unit tests in watch mode. |
| `test:e2e` | `playwright test` — end-to-end suite (`tests/e2e/**`). |
| `schema` | `UPDATE_SCHEMA=1 vitest run tests/unit/schemaArtifact.spec.ts` — regenerate the JSON Schema artifact from the Zod models. |
| `format` | `prettier --write .` — format (config: `.prettierrc.json`, 100 cols, double quotes, trailing commas). |
| `reference` | `node scripts/build-reference.mjs` — rebuild bundled reference data from openly-licensed sources (see [Data and Provenance](Data-and-Provenance.md)). |
| `cap:sync` / `cap:copy` | Capacitor sync / copy web assets into native shells. |
| `cap:add:android` / `cap:add:ios` | Add a native platform. |
| `cap:open:android` / `cap:open:ios` | Open the native project in Android Studio / Xcode. |
| `native:android` | `pnpm build && cap sync android && cap open android`. |
| `native:ios` | `pnpm build && cap sync ios && cap open ios`. |

The `reference` script and its siblings under `scripts/` (`build-heritage-*.mjs`,
`build-landmarks-seed.mjs`, `build-languages.mjs`, `build-sovereignty.mjs`) are
**build-time aggregators**: they reshape existing openly-licensed datasets into the
bundled `public/reference/*.json` files. The app itself never invents reference data.

---

## Testing

Tests are a constitutional quality gate, not an afterthought: *"Core logic (stats,
import/export, schema validation, sanitization) MUST be covered by automated tests.
Import/sanitization paths MUST have security-focused tests."*
(`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, Development Workflow & Quality Gates).

### Unit tests — Vitest

- Config: the `test` block in `apps/postcards/vite.config.ts` (jsdom environment,
  globals on, `include: tests/unit/**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}`).
- Setup: `tests/setup.ts` pulls in `@testing-library/jest-dom` and loads the **real**
  bundled reference data (`cities-all.json`, `subdivisions.json`, `airports.json`)
  synchronously via `initReferenceDataSync`, so unit tests exercise the actual gazetteer.
- ~36 unit spec files under `tests/unit/`, covering the constitutionally-mandated
  surfaces and more: `stats.spec.ts` / `statsPerf.spec.ts` (coverage math),
  `schema.spec.ts` / `schemaArtifact.spec.ts` (Zod models + generated JSON Schema),
  `sanitize.spec.ts` + `importCsv.spec.ts` (inert-data import),
  `backup.spec.ts` / `exportCsv.spec.ts` (portable file round-trips), `bcbp.spec.ts`
  (boarding-pass parsing), `encrypt.spec.ts` / `publishBundle.spec.ts` (publish),
  `syncEngine.spec.ts` / `syncMerge.spec.ts` / `syncTimestamps.spec.ts` (device sync),
  and feature logic (`visits`, `travel`, `journal`, `experiences`, `wikivoyage`,
  `gazetteer`, `search`, `mapSource`, `offlineTiles`, …).

```bash
pnpm --filter postcards test          # once
pnpm --filter postcards test:watch    # watch mode
```

### End-to-end tests — Playwright

- Config: `apps/postcards/playwright.config.ts`. `testDir: ./tests/e2e`, `baseURL:
  http://localhost:4173`. The `webServer` block runs `pnpm build && pnpm preview
  --port 4173` automatically, so e2e always tests the **production build**. It prefers
  a preinstalled Chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/...` when present, otherwise Playwright's
  own browser.
- ~15 e2e spec files under `tests/e2e/`, one per critical guarantee: `a11y.spec.ts`,
  `keyboard.spec.ts`, `privacy.spec.ts`, `offline.spec.ts`, `import-security.spec.ts`,
  `import-csv.spec.ts`, `smoke.spec.ts`, plus feature flows (`trips`, `tripedit`,
  `tripfilter`, `airports`, `boardingpass`, `countryscope`, `globe`, `photo`).
  `nav-helper.ts` is a shared navigation helper, not a test.

```bash
pnpm --filter postcards test:e2e
```

### Accessibility gate — axe-core

`tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts` enforces WCAG 2.1 AA (spec success criterion **SC-005**):
it drives the app through the map, stats, places, passport, and settings screens and
asserts **zero serious/critical** axe violations on each, using `@axe-core/playwright`
with the `wcag2a wcag2aa wcag21a wcag21aa` tag set. Accessibility is keyboard-first and
non-negotiable per the constitution — `keyboard.spec.ts` covers keyboard-only operation.

### Privacy & security gates

`privacy.spec.ts` asserts zero unexpected external network requests (the local-first,
no-telemetry promise), and `import-security.spec.ts` + `sanitize.spec.ts` verify that
imported data is validated and sanitized, never executed (data is inert). These are the
tests that keep the [constitution](Privacy-and-Constitution.md) honest.

---

## Continuous integration

Two GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- **`tests.yml`** — the quality-gate workflow. On every push (to the deploy branch) and
  every pull request it runs, in order: `typecheck` → unit tests → install Playwright
  Chromium → e2e tests (including the a11y gate). Node 22, pnpm via
  `pnpm/action-setup`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- **`pages.yml`** — builds with `VITE_BASE=/Postcards/` and deploys the PWA to GitHub
  Pages. See [Publishing](Publishing.md).

Keep the lockfile committed and current: CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile` and will
fail if `pnpm-lock.yaml` is out of sync.

See [Architecture](Architecture.md) for how the `src/` seams (`MapSource`, schema,
store, reference) fit together at runtime.

## Spec-Driven Development (Spec Kit)

Postcards uses **GitHub Spec Kit**. The constitution mandates it: *"Every feature flows
through the Spec Kit workflow … No implementation without an approved spec and plan."*
The engine lives in `.specify/` (templates, bash scripts, workflow definition) and is
driven through slash commands:

```
/speckit-specify  →  (/speckit-clarify)  →  /speckit-plan  →  /speckit-tasks  →  /speckit-implement
```

| Step | Command | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specify | `/speckit-specify` | `spec.md` — user scenarios, requirements, success criteria (the *what/why*, no tech). |
| Clarify | `/speckit-clarify` | up to 5 targeted questions, answers folded back into `spec.md` (optional). |
| Plan | `/speckit-plan` | `plan.md` (+ `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`) — the *how*, gated by a **Constitution Check**. |
| Tasks | `/speckit-tasks` | `tasks.md` — dependency-ordered, story-grouped tasks with test tasks included. |
| Implement | `/speckit-implement` | code that satisfies the tasks. |

Supporting commands also exist: `/speckit-analyze` (cross-artifact consistency),
`/speckit-checklist`, `/speckit-constitution`, `/speckit-converge`, and
`/speckit-taskstoissues`.

**The Constitution Check is the hard gate.** Every `plan.md` must include a section
confirming alignment with the principles in [Privacy and Constitution](Privacy-and-Constitution.md);
any violation must be justified explicitly or the design revised. Features that drift
toward trip planning, social networking, or server-backed services are rejected as
scope creep — the mandate is *store data and display it well*.

---

## Where specs live

`specs/` holds one directory per feature. `specs/README.md` is the index.

- **`001-cities-countries/`** — the MVP, and the only feature carrying the **full**
  workflow artifacts: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`,
  `contracts/` (`map-source.md`, `portable-data-file.md`, `reference-data.md`),
  `checklists/requirements.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `tasks.md`.
- **`002-`…`014-`** — later features. Most are **retro-specs**: `spec.md` (sometimes
  `plan.md`) written *after* the feature shipped, by design. They cover place types,
  travel log, the offline-map seam, native packaging, boarding-pass import, journal,
  moments, passport poster, Wikivoyage guides, photo gallery, journal publishing,
  device sync, and intra-city places.

### Workflow exceptions & retro-specs

Several features beyond the MVP were built during rapid iteration guided by the
constitution **directly** rather than by a written spec, then retro-specified. That
exception is recorded explicitly (never silently) in
[`docs/WORKFLOW-EXCEPTIONS.md`](../docs/WORKFLOW-EXCEPTIONS.md), which lists exactly
which features shipped spec-first vs. retro-spec, and states the policy going forward:

> New feature-sized work SHOULD return to the spec-first workflow (`/speckit-specify`).
> … if one of [the retro-specced features] grows materially, that growth gets a spec first.

So: retro-specs are documentation of what shipped; new material work starts from a spec.

---

## Contributing (honoring the constitution)

Postcards is AGPL-3.0-or-later, open source for personal, non-commercial use. The bar
for a change is not "does it work" but "does it honor the
[constitution](Privacy-and-Constitution.md)". Before opening a PR:

1. **Start from a spec for new features.** Feature-sized work goes through
   `/speckit-specify` → `/speckit-plan` (with a passing Constitution Check) →
   `/speckit-tasks` → `/speckit-implement`. Small fixes don't need a spec, but must
   still respect the principles.
2. **Stay an aggregator, never an author.** All world facts come from named,
   openly-licensed external datasets with recorded provenance. Missing data becomes a
   separate shareable dataset (and a `scripts/build-*.mjs` aggregator), never
   hard-coded reference facts in app code. See [Data and Provenance](Data-and-Provenance.md).
3. **Keep it local-first and private.** No server, no account, no telemetry; the device
   is the source of truth; data leaves only on explicit user action. The `privacy`
   e2e test must stay green.
4. **Keep imported data inert.** Anything imported is validated (Zod) and sanitized,
   never executed. Import/sanitization paths need security-focused tests
   (`import-security`, `sanitize`).
5. **Respect the seams.** Consume maps only through `MapSource`; never read tiles from
   hard-coded app-private paths (offline maps must stay device-global/cross-app for the
   wider Capacitor ecosystem). Keep reference vs. personal data strictly separated.
6. **Meet the quality gates.** `pnpm --filter postcards typecheck`, unit tests, and e2e
   (including the axe WCAG 2.1 AA gate and keyboard-only flows) must all pass — the same
   `tests.yml` CI runs on every PR. Add tests for core logic you touch.
7. **Format before committing.** `pnpm --filter postcards format` (Prettier).
8. **Don't add scope creep.** Trip *planning*, social/leaderboard features, and
   server-backed services are explicitly out of scope.
